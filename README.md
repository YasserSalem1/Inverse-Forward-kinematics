# Inverse-Forward-kinematics

This repository contains code and documentation for solving the Inverse and Forward Kinematics of a 4-degree-of-freedom (4-DOF) robotic arm. The purpose of this software is to calculate the joint angles required to achieve a desired end-effector position (Inverse Kinematics) and to calculate the end-effector position given the joint angles (Forward Kinematics).
